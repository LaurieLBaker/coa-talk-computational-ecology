# Vaccination Planning in the Wild
 
???

The first example is an example of wildlife vaccination planning. 


---
# Background

#### - Only two diseases have been eliminated worldwide: small pox and rinderpest.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1050, fig.align='center', fig.alt="Two pictures: one of patient's leg with small pox and the other of cattle that have died from rinderpest"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/small_pox_rinderpest.PNG")

```

#### - Mass vaccination can reduce the burden of diseases. Spatial planning of vaccination campaigns requires understanding of local transmission dynamics. 

???
- Only two infectious diseases have been eliminated worldwide: small pox and rinderpest.

- However, it is unclear how long vaccination programs must operate to eliminate infection. 

- In this talk I am going to explore two different vaccination strategies applied to fox rabies

* Rabies is an RNA lyssavirus that causes encephalitis in a large range of mammals.

# Susceptible Individuals

Susceptible individuals $S$ in region $r$, in month $t$ were modeled as a function of juvenile foxes entering the population $j_{r,t}$, surviving individuals $C_{r,t}$ and those removed due to vaccination $V_{r,t}$ or infection $I_{r,t}$:

\begin{eqnarray}
S_{r,t+1} = j_{r,t} + C_{r,t} - V_{r,t} - I_{r,t}
\end{eqnarray}

---
# Infected individuals

Infected individuals are modeled as:

\begin{eqnarray}
I_{r,t} = (1-\rho_{r})I^{*}_{r,t} + \sum_{i \not= r} \rho_{i}l_{i,r}I^{*}_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray}

where $I^{*}_{r,t}$ is the number of infected individuals in region $r$ prior to any movement. Infected individuals leave the region with probability $\rho_{r}$. The summation term represents incursions from other regions as a function of rabies incidence $I^{*}_{i,t}$ in region $i$, the proportion of infected animals leaving region $i$: $\rho_{i}$, and $l_{i,r}$ the proportion of those moving to region $r$. 

---
# Vaccinated Individuals

Vaccinated individuals were modeled as:
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{r,t+1} = v_{r,t} + X_{r,t}
\label{eq_vac}
\end{eqnarray}

where $v_{r,t}$ represents the newly vaccinated individuals drawn from a binomial distribution. $X_{r,t}$ represent surviving vaccinated individuals.

\begin{eqnarray}
v_{r,t} \sim B(\nu\frac{S_{r,t}}{S_{r,t}+V_{r,t}}, S_{r,t})
\end{eqnarray}

and $\nu$ is the rate of bait uptake by the population of susceptible and vaccinated individuals in region $r$ at time $t$. The bait uptake rate $\nu$ was given a fixed Beta prior with mean 0.30 and variance of 0.005 based on field studies. 

---
# Observation Process

We assumed that infected individuals $I_{r,t}$ were observed imperfectly each year with probability $\theta_y$:

\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{I}_{r,t} \sim Bin(\theta_y, I_{r,t})
\end{eqnarray}


where the observational noise $\theta_y$ varies stochastically on an annual basis. 

In the cross-sectional sampling regime, hunted foxes $H_{r,t}$ had a probability of being observed to be infected equal to the risk of transmission $p_{r,t}$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{H}pos_{r,t} \sim B(p_{r,t}, H_{r,t})
\end{eqnarray}

where $\widehat{H}pos_{r,t}$ is the number of positive cases out of the total foxes hunted $H_{r,t}$.

### Autumn campaigns required in rabies-free regions

]


???

This figure shows the probability of elimination and ranked importance of campaigns across epidemiological scenarios. Left panels show the probability of elimination from all five regions in response to incremental vaccination (mean, and shaded 95% CI). (a) In the endemic scenario, 21 campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions. (b) In the high-risk scenario, 19 campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions, with vaccination of the endemic regions ranked first, and vaccination after the birth pulse (months 56 and 68) contributing most to the probability of elimination. A minimum of two or three campaigns was required in neighbouring rabies-free regions. (c) In the endgame scenario, nine campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions.


What we can see from these results is that:

1. Similar effort is required in high-risk and endemic, even though fewer regions were initially infected. 


2. Autumn campaigns were ranked highest and resulted in the greatest reductions in rabies because they come after the birth pulse. 

3. Vaccination needed in rabies-free regions. Because rabies moves across borders, vaccination is still required in neighboring regions.

]
]



???

I also looked at what happens when things go wrong and we miss campaigns.

* We found that consecutive and coordinated vaccination across geographical regions is required to rapidly control and eliminate rabies

* Incomplete vaccination (missing campaign sets) compromised time to elimination, with the same or more effort required to achieve elimination and meet similar timelines. 

- It is, therefore, important that policymakers commit to the full elimination timeline and strive to maintain comprehensive coverage to eliminate persistent foci and prevent further costs.
