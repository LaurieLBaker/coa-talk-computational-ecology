# Vaccination Planning in the Wild
 
???

The first example is an example of wildlife vaccination planning. 


---
# Background

### - Only two diseases have been eliminated worldwide: small pox and rinderpest.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1050, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Two pictures: one of patient's leg with small pox and the other of cattle that have died from rinderpest"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/small_pox_rinderpest.PNG")

```

### - Mass vaccination can reduce the burden of diseases.

???
- Only two infectious diseases have been eliminated worldwide: small pox and rinderpest.

- Mass vaccination can greatly reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. 

- However, it is unclear how long vaccination programs must operate to eliminate infection. 

- In this talk I am going to explore two different vaccination strategies applied to fox rabies

---
# Process of elimination

### - How long control programs must run is unclear.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1090, fig.align='center', fig.cap="The stages of elimination"}

```

.foot_note[
Stages toward and after elimination in a given location and milestones on the path to elimination. Shading illustrates control intensity (darker grey for heightened efforts). *Klepac et al. 2013. Towards the endgame and beyond. Phil Trans B.* ]

???

* Greater effort is often required to eliminate the disease than control the disease.
* In the end stages, the disease becomes more difficult to detect, and low case numbers mean that a disease drops in priority.
* The successful elimination of rabies from Western Europe presents a unique opportunity to study disease persistence and explore the timing of vaccination control strategies.

### Autumn vaccination campaigns in rabies-free regions required

]


???

This figure shows the probability of elimination and ranked importance of campaigns across epidemiological scenarios. Left panels show the probability of elimination from all five regions in response to incremental vaccination (mean, and shaded 95% CI). (a) In the endemic scenario, 21 campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions. (b) In the high-risk scenario, 19 campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions, with vaccination of the endemic regions ranked first, and vaccination after the birth pulse (months 56 and 68) contributing most to the probability of elimination. A minimum of two or three campaigns was required in neighbouring rabies-free regions. (c) In the endgame scenario, nine campaigns were required to eliminate rabies from all regions.


What we can see from these results is that:

1. Similar effort is required in high-risk and endemic, even though fewer regions were initially infected. 


2. Autumn campaigns were ranked highest and resulted in the greatest reductions in rabies because they come after the birth pulse. 

3. Vaccination needed in rabies-free regions. Because rabies moves across borders, vaccination is still required in neighbouring regions.

Computer science and data science can provide us with the tools to tackle complex issues. But we bring the knowledge, the context, and importantly the human experience and perspectives to make our work meaningful and equitable. 

Data is always a simplification of the human experience and it is important that in our data science projects we ask the questions like those set out by Catherine D'Ingazio and Lauren Klein: "Data Science By Whom"? "Data Science For Whom?"?, "Data Science with whose interests in mind?" 

We also need to value local knowledge and support communities in finding their own solutions to questions.

Drawing on a collection of over 100 historical advertisements compiled during my time as an intern at Old Sturbridge Village, this presentation will explore demographic trends among women professionals in the needle trades in New England between 1790 and 1850. Through statistical analysis and data visualization in R, I will present a picture of women’s roles in the fashion industry in this particular place and time, and discuss the impact of these findings on how we view women professionals and clothing in the past.

I also looked at what happens when things go wrong and we miss campaigns.

* We found that consecutive and coordinated vaccination across geographical regions is required to rapidly control and eliminate rabies

* Incomplete vaccination (missing campaign sets) compromised time to elimination, with the same or more effort required to achieve elimination and meet similar timelines. 

- It is, therefore, important that policymakers commit to the full elimination timeline and strive to maintain comprehensive coverage to eliminate persistent foci and prevent further costs.

# Foxes

* Most widespread terrestrial carnivore in Europe

* Territorial with high population turnover 
  * Most foxes live up to 4 years. 
  * Large birth pulse in spring where the population doubles.

# Rabies

* Rabies is a deadly disease that kills over 59,000 people each year.
* An RNA virus that causes encephalitis in a large range of mammals.

* Rabies is a deadly disease that kills over 59,000 people each year, with many millions more requiring expensive life-saving vaccines.
* Rabies is an RNA lyssavirus that causes encephalitis in a large range of mammals. 
* This map shows the primary reservoirs (that is the hosts that perpetuate this disease).
* The main reservoir in Europe is the red fox.
